                       <ul className="disc">
                          <li>Thermodynamics: The study of heat transfer, energy conservation, and the relationship between various forms of energy in mechanical systems.</li>
                          <li>Fluid Mechanics: Involves understanding the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) and applying that knowledge to systems like pumps, turbines, and heat exchangers.</li>
                          <li>Dynamics and Vibrations: Mechanical engineers analyze forces and motions within systems. This includes understanding vibrations in structures and machinery to prevent failure or inefficiency.</li>
                          <li>Materials Science: The study of material properties and the selection of the right materials for specific engineering applications, like metals, polymers, ceramics, or composites.</li>
                          <li>Manufacturing Processes: Involves understanding the processes used to create components, including casting, welding, machining, and additive manufacturing (3D printing).</li>
                          <li>Control Systems: The application of feedback and control systems in mechanical devices, used extensively in robotics, automation, and systems requiring precise operation.</li>
                          <li>Design and CAD (Computer-Aided Design): Mechanical engineers use design software to create detailed models and simulations of systems and products before they are physically produced.</li>

                      <p  className="brand-font">Welding is a process used to join materials, typically metals or thermoplastics, by causing them to fuse together under high heat. This is achieved by melting the workpieces and often adding a filler material to form a strong bond. There are various types of welding techniques, such as MIG (Metal Inert Gas), TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas), and Stick welding, each suited to different applications and materials. The process is commonly used in industries like construction, automotive, and manufacturing to create structural components, machinery, and equipment. Welders must carefully control heat, pressure, and the environment to ensure quality and safety. </p>

                       <p className="brand-font">Electric work on a lorry involves the installation, maintenance, and repair of electrical systems within the vehicle. This includes the wiring of lights, indicators, and brake systems to ensure proper functionality. Technicians also work on the truckâ€™s battery, alternator, and starter motor to maintain power flow and start-up reliability. Electric work often includes diagnosing faults in the electrical circuit using specialized tools like multimeters. Repairing or replacing damaged wiring, fuses, and relays is common to prevent short circuits or power loss. Additionally, the electrical systems of modern lorries, including onboard computers and sensors, require attention for optimal performance. Electricians also ensure the proper connection of auxiliary equipment such as air conditioning or in-cabin electronics. They are responsible for ensuring safety features like reverse alarms and lighting systems are working correctly.</p>
